# SAS-birthday-app

The goal for this app was to create a UI that allows users to enter new employees and then be able to dynamically see all the employees that have birthdays in a given month.

By using a dropdown list, the user can filter through months and see all the employees that have birthdays in the chosen month.

The app was built using the React framework and started using the command "npx create-react-app"

*Testing
  - The app was tested manually
  - Based on the small size of the app and the limited functionality, no unit tests or integration tests were done. Also no end-to-end test were done.
 
 *Challenges
  -The biggest challenge I faced was learning React and translating what I learned into a workable app
  
  *Improvements
  - The biggest improvement I would make is connecting it to a database. I have a MongoDB database with 500 employees that I wanted to connect to the app.      I also wanted to be able to store the employees that were saved in the App, rather than losing them each time the page was refreshed.
  - I also thought that having other filters would make for a more useable app, such as filtering for cities or positions.
